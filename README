NAME
    Data::UUID::Concise - Encode UUIDs to be more concise or communicable

VERSION
    version 0.121240

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::UUID::Concise;

        my $duc = Data::UUID::Concise->new();
        my $encoded_uuid = $duc->encode((Data::UUID->new)->create);
        my $decoded_uuid = $duc->decode('M55djt9tt4WoFaL68da9Ef');

        $duc->alphabet('aaaaabcdefgh1230123');
        $duc->alphabet; # 0123abcdefgh

ATTRIBUTES
  alphabet
    This is the collection of symbols that are used for the encoding scheme.

    By default, a reasonably unambiguous set of characters is used that is
    reminiscent of the base 58 scheme used by a rather prominent photo
    site's URL shortener.

METHODS
  encode
    Encode a Data::UUID instance as a string with the appropriate set of
    symbols.

  decode
    Decode a string with the appropriate set of symbols and return a
    Data::UUID instance representing the decoded UUID.

FUNCTIONS
  _normalize_alphabet
    Private method. Normalize the alphabet such that it is sorted and that
    all elements are distinct.
